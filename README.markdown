# Private JS Dependencies: Rough Demonstration

See https://gist.github.com/damncabbage/68e61337cc15e18a52f0 for full context and explanation.

## Instructions

Clone this repo, and then:

```
$ ./install-and-build.sh
```

(This script does the require `npm install` and other tasks, then does a full demonstration build.
The output should match what's currently in the repository. Tested with 0.7.6, the current
purescript release.)
